### How do I get set up?  
1. Download script
2. Modify parameters in parameters.ps1
3. (optional) If folder structure is already in place, put VIBS in the vib subfolder of the image profile folder
3. run script
(scrip will ask to place VIBS, if vibs are not found and create subfolder structure if needed.)
